## I don't code but I use Github. 

### Wait, but why?

- Back in college, I used to save my file as `second semester term paper final revised(4).docx`. I'm still traumatized.

- I use the `nano` command when I need to write/edit something quick. I prefer low-memory program because I use an Acer travelmate. 

- Branches are easier to manage than layers upon laters of nested folders that eventually resemble a matrjoschka doll with Richard Nixon's face.

- I love Markdown-- the lean, athletic, albeit less capable brother of HTML.

- `git log` helps me get right back where I left off.

### Some words of warning

- There is a learning curve.

- I still don't know when a task is big enough to warrant its own branch.

- When do I pull? Which branch do I have to be when I do `git pull origin [branch name]`?

- Sometimes when I switch branches, the files carry over. I have no idea what I'm doing with my life.

- `git log` is not a magic potion. You need to learn how to write a meaningful commit message.

XOFF ignored, mumble mumble. Don't use `ctrl + S`, use `ctrl + O` instead or you're dead. I'm done writing.
